Basic usage
-----------

.. code-block::

    replacer [OPTIONS] PATTERN REPLACEMENT [FILES ...]

Note that internally, we'll call Python with::

    re.sub(<PATTERN>, <REPLACEMENT>, line)

for each line of every regular file found in the current working directory.

This means you can use fancy backward references with `\1`

* By default hidden files, and files matching
  ``build-*, .git, .svn, *.py[co], *.[oa] , *.back, *~ , *.so, *.a``
  will be ignored

* If ``FILES`` is given, replacement will be performed on the files given
  as argument.

* You can also specify ``--file-filter`` to specify a pattern to match against
  the filenames. For instance, to replace in every `.c` file, use::

    replacer spam eggs --file-filter '*.c'

* You can create a backup for each modified file by using ``--backup``

Advanced usage
